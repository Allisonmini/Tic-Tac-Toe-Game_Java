# Tic Tac Toe - Java GUI Game ❌⭕  
A simple two-player Tic Tac Toe game with a graphical user interface using Java Swing.

---

## Description

This project also started as a class exercise in my Computer Science course. My professor provided us with the basic logic in the terminal. I decided to go beyond that by building a full desktop GUI version using **JFrame** and **Java Swing**.

Players take turns placing their mark, the game automatically checks for a win or draw, and there’s a reset button to start over.

## 💬 Personal Note

This was a great way for me to apply what I learned in class and see how simple logic could become an actual app. Converting a console game into a GUI project made it more exciting and gave me hands-on experience with Java Swing.
