# Tic Tac Toe Java Game with GUI
 A simple 2-player Tic Tac Toe game in Java (console-based)
 
##  Description
This project is based on an exercise from my Java class. My professor gave us the logic part of the game, but I decided to take it a step further by creating a complete GUI version using `JFrame` and Java Swing. Instead of just printing the results in the terminal, I wanted to build something more interactive—an actual playable game!

This version allows two players to take turns, detects the winner, and includes a reset button to start a new game. It was my first time working with Java Swing, and it really helped me understand how GUI and event-driven programming works.

##  Built With
- Java SE
- Java Swing (`JFrame`, `JButton`, `JLabel`)
- IntelliJ IDEA

##  Features
- Two-player Tic Tac Toe game
- Simple graphical interface
- Automatically detects winner or draw
- Reset button to restart the game
- Organized using Object-Oriented Programming

## 📁 Files
- `MyTicTacToe.java` –  Builds the GUI and connects logic with user interaction
- `Main.java` – Starts the game
- `TicTacToeGame.jar` – A packaged Java archive containing the core game logic and functionality.


## Personal Note
As a Computer Science student, I like making my learning visible and more fun. This was just an exercise at first, but turning it into a real GUI game made it so much more exciting. It’s one of my first Java GUI projects, and I’m proud of how it turned out!
